    "# PCPP Exam Actual Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These exam questions are based on [here](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/python-institute/pcpp-32-101/view/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q1: Composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought *Composition is based on has a relation* but it's actually **Composition allows a class to be projected as a container of different classes** because it a class could contain instances of other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: Look at the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class OwnMath:\n",
    "    pass \n",
    "\n",
    "def cal_val(num,denom):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        val = num/denom\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "        raise OwnMath from e\n",
    "    return val \n",
    "\n",
    "cal_val(4,0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So I knew this was part of implicit or explicit chained exceptions. I thought it was *explicit* because we're explicitly raising OwnMath but it's actually erroneous because OwnMath does inherit BaseException.\n",
    "- Inherit chained = raising without a `from` keyword \n",
    "- Explicit = raising with a `from` keyword like in this case `raise OwnMath from e`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3: Look at the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Sword:\n",
    "    var1 = 'weapon'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.name = 'Excalibur'\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So Excalibur is the value passed to an instance variable. We know that __init__ is the constructor so we passed a value to that instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q4: This code reflects what OOP pillar?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print(\"A is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"B is flying\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class C:\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print(\"C is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for ele in A(), B(), C():\n",
    "    ele.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly Polymorphism because several classes could have the same method. Different objects can operate the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q5: Choose the statement that best describes the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_dec(coating):\n",
    "    def lvl1_wrap(my_func):\n",
    "        def lvl2_wrap(*args):\n",
    "            our_func(*args)\n",
    "        return lvl2_wrap\n",
    "    return lvl1_wrap\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is indeed a decorator; however, it's erroneous because `my_func` is passed in the level 1 wrapper but we're using `our_func` in the level 2 wrapper. Otherwise it would've been an example of a decorator that accepts its own arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q6: Explain the code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def f1(*arg, **args):\n",
    "    pass \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say this is syntactically incorrect but you won't get any errors so **the \\*args holds a list of unnamed parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q7: Is this code correct or what do we have to add\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Crossword:\n",
    "    number_of_Crosswords = 0 \n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, height, width):\n",
    "        self.height = height \n",
    "        self.width = width \n",
    "        self.progress = 0 \n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def isElementCorrect(word):\n",
    "        if self.isSolved():\n",
    "            print('The crossword is already solved')\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        result = True \n",
    "        for char in word:\n",
    "            if char.isdigit():\n",
    "                result = False \n",
    "                break \n",
    "        return result \n",
    "\n",
    "    def isSolved(self):\n",
    "        if self.progress == 100\n",
    "            return True \n",
    "\n",
    "    def getNumberOfCrosswords(cls):\n",
    "        return cls.number_of_Crosswords\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is **erroneous** because we're missing a `:` in `if self.progress == 100` but also since we're making a **classmethod** with `cls` in `def getNumberOfCrosswords(cls)` we actually need a `@classmethod`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q8: Look at the code and describe it \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Item:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, initial_value)\n",
    "        self.value = initial_value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __ne__(self, other):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is erroneous because there's no `:` in `def __init__(self, initial_value)` but the `__ne__(self, other)` is responsible for the support of the **inequality operator**. it works like the `!=` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q9: Which function or operator should you use to obtain the answer True or False to the question \"Do two variables refer to the same object?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "the `is` keyword to see if the variables refer to the same object \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q10: Which sentence about the @property decorator is false? \n",
    "\n",
    "The @property decorator should be defined after the method that is responsible for setting an encapsulated attribute. (False)\n",
    "\n",
    "The @property is **before** the method that's responsible for setting an attribute \n",
    "\n",
    "It's used to create a *read-only* property and methods for *setting* and *deleting* the attribute should have decorators like `@<attr_name>.setter` and `@<attr_name>.deleter`. It goes `@property` to return attributes --> `@property_func_name.setter` for changing the property --> then `@property_func_name.deleter` to remove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q11: Select the true statement about the __name__ attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "`__name__` is a special attribute, which is inherent for classes, and it contains the name of a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q12: What is a static method? \n",
    "\n",
    "CA method that requires no parameters **referring to the class itself**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q13: What is true about type in the object-oriented programming sense? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the topmost type that any class can inherit from. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q14: What does the term deserialization mean? (Choose the best answer.) \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a process of **creating Python objects** based on sequences of bytes.  Serialization is **converting an object to a sequence of bytes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q15: What is a __traceback__? (Choose two.) \n",
    "\n",
    " An attribute owned by every exception object **AND** An attribute that holds interesting information that is particularly useful when the programmer wants to store exception details in other objects \n",
    " \n",
    "## Q16: Which of the following examples using line breaks and different indentation methods are compliant with PEP 8 recommendations? (Choose two.) \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "spam = my_function(arg1, arg1,\n",
    "                    arg3, arg4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [\n",
    "    1, 2, 3,\n",
    "    4, 5, 6,\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q17: Look at the following examples of comments and docstrings in Python Select the ones that are useful and compliant with PEP 8 recommendations. (Choose two.) \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def area_price(area, price=1.25):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate the area in square meters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Keyword Arguments:\n",
    "        area -- land area\n",
    "        price -- price per sq/m\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example that illustrates creating\n",
    "# a two-element list, and printing\n",
    "# the list contents to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [a,b]\n",
    "print(myst_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q18: Select the true statement related to PEP 257. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute docstrings and Additional docstrings are two types of extra docstrings that can be extracted by software tools. \n",
    "- ```python\n",
    "  class MyClass:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  attrbute1 = 42\n",
    "  \"\"\"This is the docstring for attribute1\"\"\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Additional docstring could be placed in locations other than the first statement in a module, function or class def\n",
    "\n",
    "However, take this into account, **String literals that occur in places other than the first statement in a module, function, or class definition can act as documentation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q19: Select the true statements related to PEP 8 programming recommendations for code writing. (Choose two.) \n",
    "\n",
    "You should make object type comparisons using the **isinstance() method** (e.g., if isinstance(obj, int):) instead of comparing types directly (e.g., if type(obj) is type(1)).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not write string literals that rely on significant trailing whitespaces, as they may be visually indistinguishable, and certain editors may trim them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q20: Select the true statements related to PEP 8 naming conventions. (Choose two.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Function and variable names should be lower-case with words separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always use self as the first argument to instance methods, and cls as the first argument to class methods.\n",
